## About

I build modern, scalable and well-structured digital interfaces.

My background is focused on web applications using React and Next.js, and I am also working with mobile development using React Native.

I approach frontend engineering with a product mindset prioritizing architecture, performance, maintainability and user experience across platforms.

I have experience building complex interfaces, integrating REST APIs, designing reusable component systems and implementing scalable frontend architecture for data-driven applications.


## What I Work On

- Development of modern web and mobile applications
- Component-driven architecture
- API integration
- Authentication flows and business rules
- Implementation of complex client-side interaction flows and validation systems
- Clean code and scalable structures
- Performance and user experience optimization
